Releases
========


Version 1.1.0
=============

Notes
-----

* Added a new module `zmf_sca`_ for SAF based z/OS security automation, which starts with the security validation.
* The new module zmf_sca is based on the REST API of the z/OSMF Security Configuration Assistant (SCA).
  SCA supports the json format of the security descriptor file. This file can be used to document security requirements
  by function or by product. With the security descriptor file that is easy to create,
  SCA is able to display and automatically validate security requirements in a flexible granularity,
  either by individual requirement, by function or by product. SCA is based on the SAF interface,
  therefore it supports all SAF based security products in most cases. To learn more about z/OSMF SCA, please refer to
  the `SCA demo`_ in IBM MediaCenter.
* The new module zmf_sca can be used in use cases like security validation, security audit, etc.
* Added a new cloud provisioning and management (CP&M) role zmf_cpm_list_software_templates to obtain list of published
  software templates that can be provisioned by user who is requesting to obtain the list.
  List of templates is saved in a file system and contains detailed information about each software template.
* Added a new CP&M role zmf_cpm_create_software_instance to create a software
  instance in z/OSMF CP&M software instance registry. A json file with various properties for the instance can
  be provided to save instance specific properties in the registry.
* Added a new CP&M role zmf_cpm_get_software_instance to obtain a specific software instance from the z/OSMF CP&M
  software instance registry. Retrieved software instance along with associated properties is saved in a file system.
