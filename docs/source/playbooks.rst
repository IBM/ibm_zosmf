Playbooks
=========

An `Ansible playbook`_ consists of organized instructions that define work for
a managed node (host) to be managed with Ansible.

There are many playbooks available in the `samples repository`_ contributed by
the Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z team.
The Git samples repository contain playbooks that demonstrate various topics.

Refer to the RedHat Ansible Certified Content documentation for more on the
`playbooks`_.
