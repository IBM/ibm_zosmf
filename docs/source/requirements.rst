Requirements
============

The **IBM z/OSMF collection** requires both a **control node** and
**managed node** be configured with a minimum set of requirements.
The control node is often referred to as the **controller** and the managed
node as the **host** or **target**.

Refer to RedHat Ansible Certified Content documentation for more on the
`controllers dependencies`_.
