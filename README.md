IBM z/OSMF collection
=====================

The **IBM zOSMF collection**, also represented as **ibm_zosmf** in this
document, is part of the broader initiative to bring Ansible Automation to IBM
Z® through the offering **Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®**.
The **IBM z/OSMF collection** supports automation tasks such as configuration
management, application deployment, and provisioning on z/OS.

Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z
===========================================

**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** provides the ability to
connect IBM Z® to clients' wider enterprise automation strategy through the
Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem.
This enables development and operations automation on Z through a seamless,
unified workflow orchestration with configuration management, provisioning,
and application deployment in one easy-to-use platform.

The **IBM z/OSMF collection** is following the
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®** method of distributing
content.
Collections will be developed in the open, and when content is ready
for use it is released to
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/ibm/ibm_zosmf) for community
adoption.
Once contributors review community usage, feedback, and are satisfied with the
content published, the collection will then be released to
[Ansible Automation Hub](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub)
as **certified** and **IBM supported** for
**Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform subscribers**.

For guides and reference, please review the
[documentation](https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/index.html).
