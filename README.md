IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) Collection
================================================

The **IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) collection**, also represented as
**ibm_zosmf** in this document, is part of the broader initiative to bring
Ansible Automation to IBM Z® through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z**.

The **IBM z/OSMF collection** supports automation tasks such as operating z/OS
workflows, provisioning and managing z/OS middlewares/softwares, via z/OSMF
RESTful services.

Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z
===========================================

The **Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** provides the ability to
connect IBM Z® to clients' wider enterprise automation strategy through the
Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem. This enables development and operations
automation on Z through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with
configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in one
easy-to-use platform.

The **IBM z/OSMF collection** is following the
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®** method of distributing
content.
Collections will be developed in the open, and when content is ready
for use it is released to
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ibm/ibm_zosmf)
for community adoption.
Once contributors review community usage, feedback, and are satisfied with the
content published, the collection will then be released to
[Ansible Automation Hub](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub)
as **certified** and **IBM supported** for
**Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform subscribers**.
