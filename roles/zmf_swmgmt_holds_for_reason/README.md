# Ansible role: zmf_swmgmt_holds_for_reason
The collection [ibm_zosmf](../../README.md) provides an [Ansible role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html), referred to as `zmf_swmgmt_holds_for_reason`, to collect ++HOLD text for selected REASON IDs into separate files for each REASON. The ++HOLD text for the selected REASON IDs
is collected using the CSI Query REST API for all Software Updates (PTFs) being installed on a Software Instance.

For guides and reference, see [Docs Site](https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zosmf/docs/source/roles/zmf_swmgmt_holds_for_reason.html).
