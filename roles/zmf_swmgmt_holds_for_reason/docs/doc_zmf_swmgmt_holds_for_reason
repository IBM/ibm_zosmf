description:
    - >
      The B(IBM z/OSMF collection) provides an Ansible role, referred to as
      B(zmf_swmgmt_holds_for_reason), to separate HOLDs by REASON and
      prepare to query the CSI associated with a software instance.

    software_instance_uuid:
        description:
            - >
              A UUID of a software instance. A UUID is assigned to every software instance and
              can be obtained using the "List the software instances defined to z/OSMF" REST API.
            - >
              A UUID can also be obtained using the zmf_swmgmt_zos_system_uuid Ansible role which
              retrieves the UUID for the software instance that represents the installed software
              for the specified z/OSMF host system.
            - >
              A software instance UUID name must be specified.
            - >
              This variable can be specified in the inventory file or as an argument on
              the playbook command.

    hold_reason:
        description:
            - >
              The HOLD REASON ID to get the HOLDDATA text for. You may specify '*' for all
              HOLD REASON IDs.
            - >
              A HOLD REASON ID must be 1-7 characters long and is accepted in mixed case and is
              folded to uppercase automatically. It may consist of alphabetic, numeric, and
              national characters (@ \# $).

              This variable can be specified in the inventory file or as an argument on

    holds_for_reason_file:
        description:
            - >
              The directory that will contain the HOLDDATA text files. One file will be
              written with the HOLDDATA text pertaining to the specific HOLD REASON each
              time this role is invoked.
            - >
              The files written in this directory will follow this naming convention where
              the file names will be a concatenation of the software instance name and the
              HOLD REASON: C(YourSoftwareInstanceName + YourHoldReason + .txt)
            - >
              The directory must already exist otherwise there will be an error writing the
              results to the file. If files exist in the directory already, they will be
              overwritten by the new response when the playbook is executed. If files
              don't exist in the directory, they will be created.

              This variable can be specified in the inventory file or as an argument on
              the playbook command.

        type: str
notes:
    - >
      The given example assumes you have an inventory file
      I(inventory.yml) that contains the values for the two variables described above:
      software instance UUID and the list of HOLD REASONs.

    - >
      When the role is executed, a message shown in following example is
      displayed, C("msg": "Output filename= /tmp/xxx/holds_for_reason_response.json").
      This message includes a file path and file name where the HOLDs and HOLDDATA text
      for the requested HOLD REASON are returned.
