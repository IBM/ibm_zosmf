role: zmf_swmgmt_zos_system_uuid
short_description: Retrieve the z/OS system UUID
description:
    - >
      The B(IBM z/OSMF collection) provides an Ansible role, referred to as
      B(zmf_swmgmt_zos_system_uuid), to retrieve the z/OS system UUID for the
      specified system nickname. The UUID identifies the software instance
      object that corresponds to the installed software for the specified
      z/OSMF host system.  The UUID can be used to uniquely identify a
      software instance object to be acted upon by other Ansible roles.
