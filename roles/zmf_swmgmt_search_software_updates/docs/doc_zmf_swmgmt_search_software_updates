    - >
      The B(IBM z/OSMF collection) provides an Ansible role, referred to as
      B(zmf_swmgmt_search_software_updates), to search a software instance for one or more software updates
      to determine which updates are installed or updates that need to be installed.

              Port number of the z/OSMF server.
              If z/OSMF is not using the default port, you need to specify a
              value for this parameter in the inventory file or as an argument on
              the playbook command.
        required: False

        description:
            - Name of the software instance.
            - >
              A software instance name must be specified when a software instance UUID
              is not specified. If both a software instance name and UUID are
              specified, then the software instance UUID is used by default.
            - >
              This variable can be specified in the inventory file or as an argument on
              the playbook command.

            - >
              A system nickname must be specified when a software instance UUID
              is not specified. If a software instance UUID is specified in 
              addition to a software instance and system nickname, then the
              software instance UUID is used by default.

              This variable can be specified in the inventory file or as an argument on
              the playbook command.

    software_instance_uuid:
        description:
            - >
              A UUID of a software instance. A UUID is assigned to every software instance and 
              can be obtained using the "List the software instances defined to z/OSMF" REST API.
            - >
              A UUID can also be obtained using the zmf_swmgmt_zos_system_uuid Ansible role which
              retrieves the UUID for the software instance that represents the installed software
              for the specified z/OSMF host system.
            - >
              A software instance UUID must be specified when a software instance name
              is not specified. If both a software instance UUID and name are
              specified, then the software instance UUID is used by default.

            - >
              The directory must already exist otherwise there will be an error writing the
              results to the file. If the file exists in the directory already, it will be
              overwritten by the new response when the playbook is executed. If the file
              doesn't exist in the directory, it will be created.

              The list of software update (SYSMOD) IDs to be searched in the subject software instance.
            - >
              This list variable needs to be in following format: C('"SYSMOD1","SYSMOD2","SYSMOD3"')
        required: True

              User ID for authenticating with a remote z/OSMF server.  Used only if the software instance resides on
              a remote z/OSMF server.
        required: False
        type: str
    remote_zmf_password:
        description:
            - Password for authenticating with a remote z/OSMF server.
        required: False
        type: str

notes:
    - >
      The given example assumes you have an inventory file
      I(inventory.yml) that contains the values for the variables described above,
      such as z/OSMF host server, userid, password, software instance name and system,
      and response file name.
    - >
      Command syntax to call a playbook using an inventory file:
        ansible-playbook -i inventory software_management_reports_CICDtest1.yml
      Command syntax to call a playbook using command arguments:
        ansible-playbook software_management_reports_CICDtest1.yml -e zmf_user=zosmf**
        -e zmf_password=zosmf**
    - >
      When the role is executed, a message shown in following example is
      displayed, C("msg": "Output filename= /tmp/xxx/search_software_updates_response.json").
      This message includes a file path and file name where the search software updates report
      for the requested software instance is returned.
