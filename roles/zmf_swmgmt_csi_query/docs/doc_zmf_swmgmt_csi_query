      The B(IBM z/OSMF collection) provides an Ansible role, referred to as
      B(zmf_swmgmt_csi_query), to query a SMP/E global zone CSI data set directly
      or to query the CSI associated with a software instance.

      The given example assumes you have an inventory file
      I(inventory.yml) that contains the values for the variables described above,

      and response file name.
