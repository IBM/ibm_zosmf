short_description: Role provisions a z/OS software service
description:
    - >
      The B(IBM z/OSMF Collection) provides an Ansible role, referred to as B(zmf_cpm_provision_software_service),
      to provision a z/OS middleware such as IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS®), IBM Db2®, 
      IBM Information Management System (IMS™), IBM MQ, and IBM WebSphere Application Server or any
      other software service by using an B(IBM Cloud Provisioning and Management (CP&M)) template.
    - >
      Template referenced by playbook must be published in I(z/OSMF Software
      Services Catalog).
    ->
      This role will generate a unique JSON file that holds provisioned instance
      information. The file location is in following format,
      C(<instance_record_dir>/<cpm_template_name>-<instance external_name>.json)

              On many system default value C("/tmp") used for this variable may not be acceptable because
              "/tmp" directory can be transient on the system. In such cases it is recommended to specify

notes:
    - >
      The given example assumes that you have an inventory file I(hosts) and host vars
      I(sampleHost.yaml) with appropriate values to identify the target z/OSMF server end point.

      When playbooks completes, a message shown in following example is
      displayed, C("msg": "Instance record saved at: /tmp/xxx.json").
      This message includes a file path and file name where instance specific
      information is returned.
      This file is required for M(zmf_cpm_manage_software_instance) and
      M(zmf_cpm_remove_software_instance) roles.
