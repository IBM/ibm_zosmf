              A software instance name must be specified when a software instance UUID
              is not specified. If both a software instance name and UUID are
              specified, then the software instance UUID is used by default.

              A UUID of a software instance. A UUID is assigned to every software instance and
              can be obtained using the "List the software instances defined to z/OSMF" REST API.
            - >
              A UUID can also be obtained using the zmf_swmgmt_zos_system_uuid Ansible role which
              retrieves the UUID for the software instance that represents the installed software
              for the specified z/OSMF host system.

              A software instance UUID must be specified when a software instance name

            - >
              The directory must already exist otherwise there will be an error writing the
              results to the file. If the file exists in the directory already, it will be
              overwritten by the new response when the playbook is executed. If the file
